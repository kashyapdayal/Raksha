**Suraksha** is a secure, offline, terminal-based password manager written in Python.  
It stores your passwords in **encrypted form** on your local Linux machine — no cloud storage, no trackers, no spying.  
It uses **AES-256 encryption via `cryptography` library** and provides **master password protection** with recovery options.

## ✨ Features

- **Local Storage Only** – Data stored in `~/.password_vault` with `chmod 700` permissions.
- **AES-256 Encryption** – Secured with `cryptography.fernet` and PBKDF2 key derivation.
- **Master Password Protection** – Access all saved credentials with one strong password.
- **Strong Password Validation** – Uses `zxcvbn` to enforce secure master passwords.
- **Password Categories** – Store passwords under `private` or `business`.
- **Password Recovery** – Multiple recovery questions, phone & email verification.
- **Colorful CLI Interface** – Enhanced visuals with `termcolor` and `pyfiglet`.
- **Secure Input** – Passwords entered via `getpass` (hidden typing).
- **Offline and Open Source** – No internet required after installation.
