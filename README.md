# **Raksha** 
RAKSHA is a Python-based password manager with a graphical interface built on Tkinter. It lets you generate, store, and retrieve passwords securely. All stored passwords are encrypted with AES-based Fernet encryption (via Python’s cryptography library)
cryptography.io
. The app also uses Python’s secrets module to generate cryptographically strong random passwords
docs.python.org
. This ensures that sensitive data stays protected and any suggested passwords are highly secure. The built-in dark/light theme toggle ("Sun" and "Moon") makes the UI easy on the eyes..

##  Features

- Master Password Protection: On first run, RAKSHA prompts you to set a master password (minimum 8 characters) and answers to a few security questions. These are used to secure your vault. The master password hash is saved to ~/.spm_master.hash for login verification.
- Secure Encryption: All password entries are encrypted with Fernet symmetric encryption cryptography.io
 and saved as .svt files in your chosen vault directory. Without the master password, the data cannot be decrypted.
- Password Strength Checker: A dedicated Password Checker tool scores any input password from 1–10. If a password is weak, the app generates suggestions of strong passwords for you.
- Strong Password Generator: The Password Saver tab can auto-generate complex passwords using Python’s secrets and string modules for high-quality randomness
docs.python.org
- Password Saver & Viewer: In Password Saver, give your password a name label and save it; the entry is encrypted and stored. In Password Viewer, double-click a saved entry to decrypt and display its name and password. The password is automatically copied to the clipboard for convenience

- Theme Toggle: Switch between Dark and Light modes from the top of the window. Your preference is remembered in the configuration.
- Settings: Change your master password (after answering security questions) or update the password storage directory (vault) at any time. Security questions can also help you recover or change the master password.

## Configuration

Config File (.spm_config.json): RAKSHA saves user settings in a file at ~/.spm_config.json. This JSON file stores your encrypted security question answers, the path of the password directory (password_dir), and the dark-mode preference. Do not edit this file by hand unless you know what you’re doing, as it contains encrypted data tied to your master password.
Password Directory (Vault): This is the folder you chose during setup (shown at the top of the Settings screen). All passwords are saved here as encrypted .svt files. The default directory (if you leave it blank) is secure_vault in the current working folder. You can change the directory anytime via Settings. Ensure the folder exists or allow RAKSHA to create it.
Master Password Hash (.spm_master.hash): Your master password (and only its hash) is stored at ~/.spm_master.hash. If this file is missing or corrupted, you will not be able to log in. Keep these hidden files safe.
